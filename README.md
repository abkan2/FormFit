## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Python** (3.8 or higher)
- **Expo CLI** (`npm install -g @expo/cli`)
- **iOS Simulator** or **Android Emulator** (for testing)
- **Firebase Project** with Authentication and Firestore enabled

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to backend directory**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create Python virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install additional ML dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install mediapipe opencv-python scikit-learn joblib numpy
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file in backend directory
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here" > .env
   ```

6. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to frontend directory**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Enable Authentication (Email/Password) and Firestore
   - Download the configuration file and update `src/lib/firebase.js`

4. **Update API endpoint**
   - In `app/(workout)/camera.jsx`, update the WebSocket URL:
   ```javascript
   const wsUrl = `ws://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:8000/api/v1/pose_detection?exercise=${selectedExercise}`;
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

6. **Run on device/simulator**
   - Press `i` for iOS simulator
   - Press `a` for Android emulator
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go app for physical device testing

### Network Configuration

For real-time pose detection to work on physical devices:

1. **Find your local IP address**
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   
   # Windows
   ipconfig | findstr "IPv4"
   ```

2. **Update WebSocket URLs** in the frontend code to use your local IP
3. **Ensure devices are on the same network** as your development machine

## üîß Development

### Running Tests
```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend && python -m pytest tests/

# Frontend linting
cd frontend && npm run lint
```

### ML Model Training
```bash
cd backend/ml
python train.py  # Train exercise detection models
```

### Database Migrations
Firebase Firestore is schema-less, but ensure proper security rules are configured in the Firebase Console.

## üìä API Documentation

When the backend is running, visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for interactive API documentation powered by FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI generation.

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## üêõ Known Issues

- Camera permissions required for pose detection
- WebSocket connections may need firewall configuration
- ML models require sufficient device performance
- Network latency affects real-time feedback quality

- [ ] Advanced analytics and progress tracking
- [ ] Social features and challenges
- [ ] Offline mode capabilities
- [ ] Wearable device integration
- [ ] Custom workout creation tools
